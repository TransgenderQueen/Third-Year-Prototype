Idea 1- Soulslike game

- Leveling up syetem with multiple different stats, that influence stats. E.G. - HP, stamina. Prehaps have a way to make items that will give you a boost to random stats
- upgrade weapon system
- Weapon attribute system and a way to farm weapons to find a stat you want(a dungeon of sorts)
- A way to refine stats and level up certain weapon attributes
- Lock on system much like soulslike games.
- different movesets for different types of weapons. E.G. Guns would obviously be a ranged weapon, whereas swords would be at meelee ranges.
- interesting movement system that includes things like grappling hooks, short dashes, rolls and even prehaps quick teleports

Idea 3 - basic factory game

 # Soulslike Game

 ## Movement
 - The game would be quite fast paced, pushing you through the open world and keeping enemies around, ready for you to fight whenever you wish.
 - There would be a jump, roll and slide, as well as a medium ranged teleport used to dodge moves.


 ## Combat
 - The combat will be designed to fun, fast and satisfying. I want to enforce players and make them want to carry on as well as reinforce replayability. We need enemies that will not be too frustrating to fight, as well as satisfying to beat.
 - The essance of souls-like games is that they will be hard, but rewarding in the long run. Once you beat a boss, they drop something that will give you a big boon or some satisfying reward.


 ## Player Character
 - Player stats. I want HP, Stamina (not including sprinting) and other statistics that will allow you to change how you fight
