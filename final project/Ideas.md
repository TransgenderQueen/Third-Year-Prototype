Idea 1- Soulslike game

- Leveling up syetem with multiple different stats, that influence stats. E.G. - HP, stamina. Prehaps have a way to make items that will give you a boost to random stats
- upgrade weapon system
- Weapon attribute system and a way to farm weapons to find a stat you want(a dungeon of sorts)
- A way to refine stats and level up certain weapon attributes
- Lock on system much like soulslike games.
- different movesets for different types of weapons. E.G. Guns would obviously be a ranged weapon, whereas swords would be at meelee ranges.
- interesting movement system that includes things like grappling hooks, short dashes, rolls and even prehaps quick teleports
