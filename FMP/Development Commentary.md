### Game Sources

I have looked at multiple games for my research, looking at crafting systems in games.
The first game is Mount and Blade: Bannerlord II. The crafting system in the weapons is quite in depth. The higher teir weapon you wish to craft, the rarer the recourses to craft it become.
<br>
The game focuses on allowing you to craft parts of a weapon at a time before adding it all together. For example a dagger head and small hilt and handle would become a dagger, or a rake head and long pole would become a pike. It allows for fun combonations that get more and more intersting.
