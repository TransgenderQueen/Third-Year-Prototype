 - This is useful for my own game as I wish to have a crafting system like this. I want to replicate the part of the system that allows you to combine different weapon blade and handle. It will be fun for players to craft weapons and play around with different ranges and attack speeds.
 - I do not want to replicate all of it however. I do not wish to include weapon teirs or cosmetics, I will have similar things in the game that would work better for my specific system.
