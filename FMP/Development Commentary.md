## Project Outline

This project will be an upgrade on my original prototype. This is based on similar souls-like games, mixed with elements from styles of games like dungeon crawlers, while including elements of weapon crafting. There are many things I wish to include in this project that will have improved since the prototype:

- Weapon crafting system
- Multiple distinct weapon types that have different movesets
- Updated animations and art and design for the world
- More dungeons, with ranging difficulty due to more enemies or bosses.

There are a few things I know I will have an issue with. I am not the most confident in my level design skills, so I know I will need to get a lot of research on how people feel about the art and design.

I additionally have not dabbled with audio before, so setting it up will be a big challenge for me, though I am confident with enough practice and testing I can get it set up.

Ultimatly I am not too worried for this. With a lot of user testing and constant feedback I can fine tune this project.


## Research

### Methodology





### Game Sources


The first game is Mount and Blade: Bannerlord II(Mount&Blade II Bannerlord - TaleWorlds Entertainment, s.d.). The crafting system in the weapons is quite in depth. The higher teir weapon you wish to craft, the rarer the recourses to craft it become.

 - I am looking at this game as I heard that people really enjoyed the crafting system, especially as it felt fun to use.

 - The game focuses on allowing you to craft parts of a weapon at a time before adding it all together. For example a dagger head and small hilt and handle would become a dagger, or a rake head and long pole would become a pike. It allows for fun combonations that get more and more intersting.

 - This is a unique way to have a weapon crafting system as it allows for a lot of flexibility and custom weapons. Players get greater satisfaction from having their own crafted weapons.
 - This is useful for my own game as I wish to have a crafting system like this. I want to replicate the part of the system that allows you to combine different weapon blade and handle. It will be fun for players to craft weapons and play around with different ranges and attack speeds.
 - I do not want to replicate all of it however. I do not wish to include weapon teirs or cosmetics, I will have similar things in the game that would work better for my specific system.

Additionally I have also looked at Vault Hunters. This is a Minecraft modpack which focuses on dungeon running. Inside of the Vaults you are able to find weapons and items that can allow you to change current weapons.

- I like the design of the game that forces you to explore and keep trying untill you gain an item. 
- It ensures the player has to try and try in order to and gain what they want in order to potentially uprade their weapons. This means that the player will constantly play to get better. 
- I will not copy everything from this game, as that would be far too unoriginal. In my game I wish to take ideas from this system. For example, items to reset the stats of weapons. When made in combonation with the ideas from Mount and Blade: Bannerlord II(Mount&Blade II Bannerlord - TaleWorlds Entertainment, s.d.), it shall end up as an interesting system

### Documentation Sources

- First off, I found a very nice video talking about making video documentatoo

## Implementation

### Process
For my project, I needed to create a system that allowed me to reroll for a wepaons stats. This meant that I needed to call only a certain part of the system that created the stats, while ignoring the system that allowed the weapons rarity amd weapon type.

<br>
However, as I went to create the system that did it, I noticed a lot of issues with the original system. When making a weapon, it would start the stat system before then deciding what weapon type and rarity it was. This was increadibly inefficent and after plenty of testing, it would often not work correctly, having different outcomes roughly about 70% of the time. 

Eventually I came up with a final outcome. I had to reorginize the system. I needed to put the weapon rarity and type before any other systems began to work.


### New Approaches  

### Testing

### Technical Difficulties
During this project, I had come up with plenty of new ideas, begining to build them up as blueprints.
However, as I continued to work on the project, I found myself hating the project more and more, being unable to work on it. As I looked at what I had made, i found myself hating it. But I eventually couldnt deal with what I worked on and deleted it all in anger. This was not a good idea, as it meant I had lost a considerable amount of work.
However, this meant I could go back and work on everything from a fresh start, learning from my mistakes.
